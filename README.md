## Ride Sharing Analysis using Matplotlib 

The present report gives an overall snapshot of the ride-sharing by city type and week of the year.

Summary table gives us a clear picture how change ride-sharing metrics by city type. The most active ride-sharing is observed in Urban cities. In this city type for observed period of time were made the largest number of rides: 1,625 rides by 2,405 drivers, in comparison to Suburban and Rural cities, where were  made 625 and 125 rides by 490 and 78 drivers respectively. 

However, although in Urban cities operate the largest number of drivers, number of rides is less than number of drivers, so on average one drivers made less that 1 ride during the observed period of time. Average Fare per ride and average Fare per driver in Urban cities are less than Fares in Suburban and Rural cities.

In Rural cities operate the smallest number of drivers, but average fare per ride and average fare per driver are the highest. 

It might be recommended to conduct additional researches that will answer why in Urban cities ride-sharing has so small demand: probably itâ€™s better to allocate drivers from Urban cities to Suburban and Rural, where the demand is a bit higher. Also new ad campaign might help to populate ride-sharing among urban people.


Multiple-Line Plot for the Sum of the Fares for Each City Type by the Week shows that Urban cities generates more income that other city types. The most successful weeks for each city type are different, so it might be interesting to conduct an additional analysis to find out what factors may have an impact on Fares by week: weather, public or sport events, long holidays, etc.
